This toolkit improves the performance of HuggingFace transformer models on downstream NLP tasks,
by domain-adapting models to the target domain of said NLP tasks (e.g. BERT -> LawBERT).

![](docs/source/domain_adaptation_diagram.png)

The overall Domain Adaptation framework can be broken down into three phases:
1. Data Selection
    > Select a relevant subset of documents from the in-domain corpus that is likely to be beneficial for domain pre-training (see below)
2. Vocabulary Augmentation
    > Extending the vocabulary of the transformer model with domain specific-terminology
3. Domain Pre-Training
    > Continued pre-training of transformer model on the in-domain corpus to learn linguistic nuances of the target domain

After a model is domain-adapted, it can be fine-tuned on the downstream NLP task of choice, like any pre-trained transformer model.

### Components
This toolkit provides two classes, `DataSelector` and `VocabAugmentor`, to simplify the Data Selection and Vocabulary Augmentation steps respectively.

## Installation
This package was developed on Python 3.6+ and can be downloaded using `pip`:
```
pip install transformers-domain-adaptation
```

## Features
- Compatible with the HuggingFace ecosystem:
    - `transformers 4.x`
    - `tokenizers`
    - `datasets`

## Usage
Please refer to our Colab guide!
